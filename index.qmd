# Welcome to my website!
I am a graduate student at Case Western Reserve University, pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Health Informatics. Alongside my studies, I work for University Health and Counseling Services, where I contribute to fostering well-being within the campus community. In my free time, I enjoy running with my dog, spending quality time with friends, attending concerts, and exploring new places through travel.

I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me and my work as both a community member and a professional. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
